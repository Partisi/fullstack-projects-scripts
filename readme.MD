# Fullstack Scripts
Easier way to get your projects up and running. Very simple libaries and files added but helps speed up development time and stops letting you wonder "how to install express with MongoDB"

## Current Scripts

# React + Firestore
Includes packages: react, axios, reacter-router-dom, redux, firestore

Note. Firestore is meant to be called on the client-side (React) directly, so no express installed here.

# React + MongoDB
Includes packages: react, axios, react-router-dom, 

MongoDB works with express server, so also installs those dependencies too!

# React + MySQL
To be added...

# NextJS + MongoDB

# NextJS + PostgreSQL
